Q2. What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?

Web Server: Web server is a program which processes the network requests of the users and serves them with files that create web pages. This exchange takes place using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
Basically, web servers are computers used to store HTTP files which makes a website and when a client requests a certain website, it delivers the requested website to the client.

Types Of Web Server:
There are several different types of web servers, each with its own functionality and performance characteristics. Here are some of the most commonly used types:

Apache HTTP Server: Apache is one of the most popular and widely used web servers. It is open-source and highly customizable, supporting various modules and extensions. Apache is known for its stability, flexibility, and ability to handle high traffic loads.

Nginx: Nginx is a lightweight and high-performance web server that excels at serving static content and handling concurrent connections. It is often used as a reverse proxy or load balancer in front of other web servers to improve performance and scalability.

Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS): IIS is a web server developed by Microsoft, primarily used on Windows servers. It offers a wide range of features and integrates well with other Microsoft technologies. IIS supports various protocols and provides good performance for ASP.NET applications.

LiteSpeed Web Server: LiteSpeed is a commercial web server known for its high performance and efficiency. It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Apache, offering better performance with lower resource usage. LiteSpeed supports Apache configuration files and modules, making migration easier.

Google Web Server (GWS): GWS is a custom web server developed by Google for its own services. It is highly optimized for handling massive amounts of traffic and is not publicly available or widely used outside of Google.

In terms of functionality, these web servers differ in the features they support, such as SSL/TLS encryption, virtual hosting, URL rewriting, caching, and more. Performance can vary based on factors like the server's architecture, concurrency handling, caching mechanisms, and how well it scales with high traffic loads.
